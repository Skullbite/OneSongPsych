# Psych Engine: One Song Psych
Fork of Psych Engine 0.5.2h to better support mods that are only one song and one difficulty.
A (somewhat) less bloated way for source modders (in this specific situation) to release mods on psych.


## Usage
- Instead than putting your instrumental and vocals in `assets/songs/<song-name>`, you just put them in `assets/song`.
- Your chart goes straight into `assets/preload/data` named as "song" (i.e song.json)
- Events also go in `assets/preload/data`.
